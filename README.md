## Image Processing

- Heatmaps

Based on [this repository](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch), which implements [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01941).

This module makes use of the aforementioned paper's output isothropic gaussian maps in order to make use of them for detecting text regions. 


- Image Utils

Module for basic and advanced image processing.
